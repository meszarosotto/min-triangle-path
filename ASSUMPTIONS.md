# Assumptions

* [11:37]
Let's assume the trinagle is a binary tree. In a binary tree every node(parent) has left and right child node, and cannot contain cycles, the edges of the binary tree is not directed.
The Breath First or Depth First search algorithm can be used to find the minimal path in the binary tree.
The shape of the triangle indicates the tree has to be balanced, which mean the level of all the leafs are equal, therefore the  length of minimal path

The triangle can be converted to a binary tree.
